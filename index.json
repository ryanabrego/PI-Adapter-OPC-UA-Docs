    "keywords": "Adapter Health Adapters produce various types of health data. This information can be used to ensure that your adapters are running properly and data is flowing to the configured OSIsoft OMF endpoints. This section details how to configure your adapters so that this health data is produced and stored at a designated endpoint as well as what types of health data are available. Configure Health Endpoints A health endpoint designates an OSIsoft OMF endpoint where adapter health information should be sent. Multiple health endpoints can be configured. The configuration for a health endpoint is essentially the same as the configuration for a typical OMF egress endpoint. Table 1. Configuration parameters for adapter health endpoints Parameter Required Type Description Id Optional string Used to uniquely identify the endpoint. This can be any alphanumeric string. If left blank, a unique value is generated automatically. Endpoint Required string The URL of the OMF endpoint to receive this health data. ClientId Required for OCS endpoints string The Client Id used for authentication with an OSIsoft Cloud Services OMF endpoint. ClientSecret Required for OCS endpoints string The Client Secret used for authentication with an OSIsoft Cloud Services OMF endpoint. Username Required for PI Web API endpoints string The username used to authenticate with a PI Web API OMF endpoint. Password Required for PI Web API endpoints string The password used to authenticate with a PI Web API OMF endpoint. BufferingEnabled Optional bool Enables or disables buffering to this endpoint. By default, buffering is enabled (\"true\"). ValidateEndpointCertificate Optional bool Used to disable verification of destination security certificate. Use for testing only with self-signed certificates; OSIsoft recommends setting this to true in production environments. Defaults to true. Available Health Data Each individual adapter data component produces a few different pieces of health data. Dynamic data is sent every minute to configured health endpoints. Device Status The device status indicates the health of this component and whether or not it is currently communicating properly with the data source. This time-series data is stored within a PI point or OCS stream, depending on the endpoint type. During healthy steady-state operation, a value of \"Good\" is expected. Property Type Description Time string Timestamp of the event. DeviceStatus string The value of the DeviceStatus. The possible statuses are: Status Meaning Good The component is connected to the data source and collecting data. ConnectedNoData The component is connected to the data source but is not receiving data from it. AttemptingFailover The adapter is attempting to failover. Starting The component is currently in the process of starting up and is not yet connected to the data source. DeviceInError The component encountered an error either while connecting to the data source or attempting to collect data. Shutdown The component is either in the process of or has finished shutting down. Next Health Message Expected This property is similar to a heartbeat. A new value for NextHealthMessageExpected will be sent by an individual adapter data component on a periodic basis while it is functioning properly. This value will be a timestamp indicating when the next value should be received. When monitoring, if the next value is not received by the indicated time, this likely means an issue has arisen. This could be an issue with the adapter, adapter component, network connection between the health endpoint and the adapter, etc. Property Type Description Time string Timestamp of the event. NextHealthMessageExpected string Timestamp when next value is expected. Health Endpoint Differences - PI Web API vs. OSIsoft Cloud Services As noted above, currently two different OMF endpoints are supported for adapter health data - That hosted by PI Web API and that hosted by OSIsoft Cloud Services. There are a few differences in how these two systems treat the associated health data. PI Web API parses the information and sends it configured PI Systems for the OMF endpoint. The static data is used to create a hierarchy on a PI AF server similar to the following: The dynamic health data is actually time-series data that is stored in PI points on a PI Data Archive and can be seen in the AF hierarchy as PI Point Data Reference attributes. OSIsoft Cloud Services currently does not have a way to store the static metadata. For OCS-based adapter health endpoints, only the dynamic data will be stored. Each value will be its own stream with the timestamp property as the single index."

    "keywords": "Delete an Adapter An adapter instance can be removed by making a DELETE call with either a REST client or the EdgeCmd utility. When an adapter instance is removed, the configuration and log files are saved into a sub-directory in case they are needed later. Any associated types, streams, and data will remain on respective endpoints. File Relocation All configuration and log files will be renamed and moved to a folder called \"Removed\" within the respective directory. Configuration files will be moved to .\\Configuration\\Removed; logs files to .\\Logs\\Removed. The files are renamed according to the timestamp of removal, e.g. FileName.json_removed_yyyy-MM-dd--hh-mm-ss. In the following example, one Modbus Adapter service is installed on a particular Windows node with the name \"ModbusService1\". A Modbus component with the name \"ModbusDeviceX\" was added and configured to this Modbus adapter and later removed. Similar behavior will be seen on Linux. This is the resulting relocation and renaming scheme after deletion: REST Command: DELETE An empty DELETE command must be made against the Id of the component to be deleted. Using cURL: curl -v -X DELETE \"http://localhost:5595/api/v1/configuration/system/components/ComponentIdToBeDeleted\" REST URLs Relative URL HTTP verb Action api/v1/configuration/system/components/{id} DELETE Deletes specified component"

    "keywords": "Configure endpoints Adapters can egress dynamic data to destinations that you supply through OMF. Supported destinations are OSIsoft Cloud Services and PI servers through PI Web API. An egress endpoint represents a destination to which data will be sent. You can specify multiple endpoints, and each egress endpoint, which is comprised of the properties specified in the Parameters section, is executed independently of all other egress endpoints, and is expected to accept OMF messages. Note: Some types, and consequently containers and data, cannot be egressed. See Egress Execution Details for more information. Configuration Procedure Note: You cannot add egress configurations manually, because some parameters are encrypted when stored to disk. You must use the REST endpoints to add/edit egress configuration. See REST Urls for additional endpoints. Complete the following to create new egress endpoints: Using any text editor, create a file that contains one or more egress endpoints in JSON form For content structure, see Examples . For a table of all available egress parameters, see Parameters . Save the file. Use any tool capable of making HTTP requests to execute a POST command with the contents of that file to the following endpoint: http://localhost:5590/api/v1/configuration/Egress/dataendpoints/ Example using cURL: Add endpoints. curl -v -d \"@Egress_DataEndpoints.config.json\" -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" -X POST \"http://localhost:5590/api/v1/configuration/Egress/dataendpoints\" curl -v -d \"@Egress_DataEndpoints.config.json\" -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" -X PUT \"http://localhost:5590/api/v1/configuration/Egress/dataendpoints\" Delete an endpoint curl -v -X DELETE \"http://localhost:5590/api/v1/configuration/Egress/dataendpoints/{id}\" Update an endpoint curl -v -d \"@Egress_DataEndpoint.config.json\" -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" -X UPDATE \"http://localhost:5590/api/v1/configuration/Egress/dataendpoints/{id}\" View endpoints. curl -v -X GET \"http://localhost:5590/api/v1/configuration/Egress/DataEndpoints\" Parameters Parameter Required Type Description Id Required string Unique identifier Endpoint Required string Destination that accepts OMF v1.1 messages. Supported destinations include OCS and PI. ClientId Required for OCS endpoint string Used for authentication with the OCS OMF endpoint. ClientSecret Required for OCS endpoint string Used for authentication with the OCS OMF endpoint. TokenEndpoint Optional for OCS endpoint string Used to retrieve an OCS token from an alternative endpoint. This is not normally necessary with OCS. Username Required for PI endpoint string Used for Basic authentication to the PI Web API OMF endpoint. Password Required for PI endpoint string Used for Basic authentication to the PI Web API OMF endpoint. ValidateEndpointCertificate Optional bool Used to disable verification of destination certificate. Use for testing only with self-signed certificates. Defaults to true. Examples Find various examples below of valid egress configurations. Egress data to OCS [{ \"Id\": \"OCS\", \"Endpoint\" : \" https://{IP/FQDN of OCS}/api/Tenants/{tenantId}/Namespaces/{namespaceId}/omf\", \"ClientId\" : \"{clientId}\", \"ClientSecret\" : \"{clientSecret}\" }] Egress data to PI Web API.

Egress is handled individually per configured endpoint. On first execution, types and containers will be egressed; subsequently only new or changed types/containers will be egressed. Type creation must be successful in order to perform container creation; likewise container creation must be successful in order to perform data egress. If an egress endpoint is removed, data flow will immediately end for that endpoint. Any buffered data for the endpoint that has been deleted will be permanently lost. Type, container, and data items are batched into one or more OMF messages when egressing. As per the requirements defined in OMF, a single message payload will not exceed 192KB in size. Compression is automatically applied to outbound egress messages. On the destination, failure to add a single item will result in the message failing. Types, containers, and data will continue to be egressed as long as the destination continues to respond to HTTP requests - retrying previous failures as needed."
