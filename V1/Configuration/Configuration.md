# Configuration

OSIsoft Adapter for OPC UA provides configuration of data source and data selection. The adapter also provides configuration of security and the ability to generate a data selection file instead of manual configuration.

The examples in the configuration topics use curl, a commonly available tool on both Windows and Linux. You can use the same operations with any programming language or tool that supports making REST calls. You can also configure OSIsoft adapters with the EdgeCmd utility. For more information, see [EdgeCmd utility](https://osisoft.github.io/OSIsoft-Adapter-OPC-UA-Docs/V1/edgecmd/V1/EdgeCmd%20utility/EdgeCmd%20utility.html). To validate successful configurations, you can accomplish data retrieval steps (GET commands) using a browser, if available on your device.
