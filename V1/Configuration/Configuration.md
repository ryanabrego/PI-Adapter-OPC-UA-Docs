# Configuration

For each OSIsoft adapter, you configure data source and data selection. OPC UA adapter also allows you to configure security and generate a data selection file instead of configuring it manually.

The examples in the configuration topics use curl, a commonly available tool on both Windows and Linux. You can use the same operations with any programming language or tool that supports making REST calls. You can also configure OSIsoft adapters with the EdgeCmd utility. For more information, see [EdgeCmd utility](https://osisoft.github.io/OSIsoft-Adapter-OPC-UA-Docs/V1/edgecmd/V1/EdgeCmd%20utility/EdgeCmd%20utility.html). To validate successful configurations, you can accomplish data retrieval steps (GET commands) using a browser, if available on your device.
